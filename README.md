# Lasso Regression — Key Points

-> This project explains the most important concepts behind **Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization)** and why it is widely used for feature selection.  
-> The focus is on understanding how L1 penalty forces coefficients to become zero, making Lasso a powerful tool for sparse models.

## Key Concepts Covered:-
-> How L1 regularization works
-> Why Lasso performs automatic feature selection
-> Difference between L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge)
-> Effect of alpha (λ) on coefficient shrinkage
-> Graphical intuition for sparsity

## What’s Inside:-
-> Conceptual explanation notebook
-> Coefficient shrinkage visualization
-> Comparison with Ridge Regression
-> Notes on bias–variance impact

## Libraries Used:-
-> NumPy  
-> Pandas  
-> Matplotlib  
-> Scikit-learn
